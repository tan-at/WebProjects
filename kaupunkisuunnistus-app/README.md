# Kaupunkisuunnistus-app

This app was made for our client Skripti ry as a part of the software engineering 2 course during my bachelors studies. The app has been used in Joensuu for city orienteering events and ATK-YTP 2023.

The users are able to access a map to see where the event's checkpoints are. The app comes with a functionality to check for user credentials, and a properly authorized administrative user is able to add teams to the event, give them points, and set up checkpoints for the map displayed on the app.

Our group designed and built the project utilizing SCRUM, Agile methods and Microsoft Azure DevOps as the main tools.

Technologies used: MongoDB, Node, Mongoose, React, JavaScript and CSS.

The app can be found hosted on https://kaupunkisuunnistus.vercel.app/
